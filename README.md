# Event-InvitationPage
Using HTML and CSS, this project creates a contemporary and eye-catching event invitation webpage. It has social media sharing icons, RSVP capabilities, silky gradients, and a glassmorphic card arrangement.
Important event information such as the title, date, and location are included in the invitation, along with a link to confirm attendance that takes recipients to a personalized confirmation page. For desktop and mobile screens, the layout is completely responsive and optimized.

 Names, dates, venues, and icons are examples of design components that are utilized only for demonstration reasons and serve as dummy material to show layout and functioning.
 How to Run the Project:

1. Click the green "Code" button above.
2. Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files.
3. Open `invitation.html` in a web browser â€” the CSS will load correctly.

 Do not use the "Raw" download button for just the HTML file, or styles may not load.
